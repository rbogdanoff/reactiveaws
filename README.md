# reactiveaws
An AWS interface/toolkit based on ReactiveX
===========================================

This project is in a 'building up' phase!!

The goal of this project is to create a toolkit lib that will provide an interface to the
AWS API using ReactiveX http://reactivex.io/ https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY

The initial idea is provide some 'out of the box' multi-step AWS utilities that uses reactive style programming.
The 'components' used to build the 'out of the box' multi-step utils could be reused to create other AWS utilities.

The eventual direction it to provide a YAML based 'custom AWS utility' builder by which a user could create
custom AWS multi-set utilities via a YAML DSL.

A secondary goal is to learn ReactiveX 

If you have any thought, let me know!! ron.bogdanoff@gmail.com

Currenty I am setting up the basic project i.e. a test harness, travis, Dockerfile, etc.
